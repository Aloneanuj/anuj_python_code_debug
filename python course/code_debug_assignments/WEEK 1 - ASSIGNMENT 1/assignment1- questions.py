# a > 5 and b >= 10
# a is 5, which is not greater than 5. So, the first part (a > 5) is False.
# b is 10, which is equal to 10. So, the second part (b >= 10) is True.
# The overall expression is False (False and True).
# a >= 5 or not b > 10
# a is 5, which is equal to 5. So, the first part (a >= 5) is True.
# b is 10, which is greater than 10. So, the second part (not b > 10) is
# False.
# The overall expression is True (True or False).
# not ( a > 5 and b > 5)
# a is 5, which is not greater than 5. So, the first part (a > 5) is False.
# b is 10, which is greater than 5. So, the second part (b > 5) is True.
# The expression inside the parentheses is False (False and True), and
# the not negates it, resulting in True.
# not ( a < 10 or not b < 10)
# a is 5, which is less than 10. So, the first part (a < 10) is True.
